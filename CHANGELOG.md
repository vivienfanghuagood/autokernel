# Changelog

## v1.2.0 -- 2026-03-12

### Enhanced Profiler (Issue #1)

- Added `--export-trace` flag to export Chrome trace JSON for HTA/trace-blame analysis
- Added `--memory-snapshot` flag to capture CUDA memory snapshots for mosaic analysis
- Added `--torch-compile-log` flag to save torch.compile logs for tlparse analysis
- Added optional HTA (Holistic Trace Analysis) integration -- when installed, runs temporal and kernel breakdown analysis
- Added exported artifacts summary with suggested next steps for each tool
- Added `HolisticTraceAnalysis` as optional `profiling` dependency

### HuggingFace Kernels Export (Issue #2)

- Added `export_hf.py` -- exports optimized kernels to HuggingFace Kernels format
- Supports CUDA C++ kernels: auto-extracts CUDA source, parses function signatures, generates `build.toml` + `torch_binding.cpp` + `__init__.py`
- Supports Triton kernels: packages as a Python module with pyproject.toml
- Generates ready-to-upload project structure compatible with `kernels upload` CLI
- Added `kernels` and `huggingface-hub` as optional `hf-kernels` dependencies

## v1.1.0 -- 2026-03-12

### Native CUDA C++ Backend

- Added 9 CUDA C++ starter kernels with advanced GPU features:
  - **matmul** -- Tensor core GEMM via `wmma` API, 128x128 tiles, double-buffered shared memory
  - **softmax** -- Warp shuffle reductions, `half2` vectorized loads, grid-stride loop
  - **layernorm** -- Welford's single-pass algorithm, `float4` vectorized loads, warp shuffle stats
  - **rmsnorm** -- Warp shuffle cascade, `rsqrtf` fast inverse sqrt, `half2` vectorization
  - **flash_attention** -- Tiled online softmax, double-buffered shared memory, causal mask support
  - **fused_mlp** -- Fused SwiGLU (gate + up + SiLU + mul), shared memory tiling
  - **cross_entropy** -- Fused online log-sum-exp + NLL in single pass, warp reductions
  - **rotary_embedding** -- `__sincosf` intrinsic, `half2` read-modify-write
  - **reduce** -- Hierarchical warp shuffle + shared memory + grid-level atomic
- Added `kernels/cuda/_compile.py` -- shared compilation utility:
  - Hash-based caching (recompile only when source changes)
  - GPU architecture auto-detection via `torch.cuda.get_device_capability()`
  - Forward declaration extraction for cross-translation-unit linking
  - Thread-safe compilation with file locking
  - Detailed error diagnostics with source line numbers
- Added `--backend triton|cuda` flag to `extract.py`
- Added CUDA C++ optimization playbook to `program.md`
- Added `ninja` as optional dependency for faster compilation

### KernelBench Integration

- Added `kernelbench/bridge.py` -- problem loader supporting 3 sources:
  - HuggingFace datasets (`--source hf`)
  - Local KernelBench repo clone (`--source local`)
  - Individual Python files (`--source file`)
  - Automatic problem analysis (50+ operation patterns)
  - Starter `ModelNew` generation with CUDA/Triton templates
- Added `kernelbench/bench_kb.py` -- 4-stage evaluation pipeline:
  - Stage 1: Correctness (5 random input trials, atol/rtol=1e-2)
  - Stage 2: Stability (NaN/Inf detection)
  - Stage 3: Determinism (3 identical runs)
  - Stage 4: Performance (CUDA event timing, trimmed median)
  - Greppable output with `fast_p` at 7 thresholds
- Added `kernelbench/scorer.py` -- batch evaluation and metrics:
  - `fast_p` metric at thresholds: 1.0x, 1.1x, 1.25x, 1.5x, 2.0x, 3.0x, 5.0x
  - Incremental scoring with JSON persistence
  - Leaderboard-style reports with progress bars
- Added `kernelbench/program_kb.md` -- agent instructions for KernelBench mode:
  - Optimization playbook per difficulty level (L1-L4)
  - CUDA C++ and Triton strategy examples
  - Decision framework and anti-patterns

### Other

- Updated README with KernelBench section, dual-backend docs, and Discord link
- Added `datasets>=2.16.0` as optional `kernelbench` dependency
